### Pitch

I'd like to build app that provides a book suggestion based on a user's local weather.

### Description

The plan would be for users to log in with Twitter (or Goodreads?), answer a few questions about their reading preferences and input their zip code, then the app would spit out a reading suggestion based on the weather results from their location, Ã  la a quick Buzzfeed quiz.

### Target Audience

So many people! Bookworms would love it. Authors would love it. People stuck inside on cold, rainy days would love it. Investors would love the idea of it, as a quick quiz with one answer would prompt people to take it again and again, trying to see all the different results.

### Integrations

* OAuth: Twitter (and Goodreads?)
* Data: Weather Underground, Goodreads
* Other: Eventually, I'm thinking it'd be fun to turn this web app into a Twitter bot, where you just tweet your zip code to the bot and the bot tweets back the book suggestion.

### Pitch

Finally, an app for those of us who wish every night could be a book club night.

### Description

With Discuss, users can browse a list of books, find a good place in their neighborhood to chat, and share an invite with their social circles.

I'm planning on pulling in data from the NY Public Library Digital Collection API. Users can input a key word and find books that match that keyword. This will spark some book ideas, as users will get a sense of what's out there to discuss. Next, users can use Google Maps to find areas of interest around them -- libraries, parks, restaurants, cafes, etc. Finally, they'll be able to take the name of the book and the name of the location they've selected, choose a date and time, and send a message to their friends inviting them to the discussion.


### Target Audience

Bookworms. Social butterflies. Single people. Etc.

### Integrations

* OAuth: Twitter
* Data: Google Maps API, New York Public Library Digital Collection API. -- was just granted access, wohoo!
* Other: TBD
