### Pitch

I'd like to build app that provides a book suggestion based on a user's local weather.

### Description

The plan would be for users to log in with Twitter (or Goodreads?), answer a few questions about their reading preferences and input their zip code, then the app would spit out a reading suggestion based on the weather results from their location, Ã  la a quick Buzzfeed quiz.

### Target Audience

So many people! Bookworms would love it. Authors would love it. People stuck inside on cold, rainy days would love it. Investors would love the idea of it, as a quick quiz with one answer would prompt people to take it again and again, trying to see all the different results.

### Integrations

* OAuth: Twitter (and Goodreads?)
* Data: Weather Underground, Goodreads
* Other: Eventually, I'm thinking it'd be fun to turn this web app into a Twitter bot, where you just tweet your zip code to the bot and the bot tweets back the book suggestion.
